about the climate change argument germany does not exist a vacuum and taking a bit economic hit to make sure that you are doing the right thing with renewable energy is not going to change the world even if the whole eu switched to 100 renewable energy and literally every single person the eu stopped driving cars with combustion engines from on it still wouldnt save the planet other countries dont feel like they have incentive to follow suit if these hypothetical changes were to be made the world is fucked either way people need to come to terms with this and stop overacting germany should just quit burning coal keep building renewable power plants at a reasonable pace without overspending out of fear and most importantly keep the nuclear power plants running and reactivate those that have not reached their due date from a technical perspective this way germany can have a climate neutral source of energy production until the renewable energy is widespread enough to fulfill the power consumption of the country the greens and other pro environment parties are out of their mind if they honestly think that nuclear power is not the best compromise between a healthy climate and what is actually achievable economically nuclear power and renewable energy should work hand hand to delay the effects of the made climate change and no sensible human being should vote for lets save our climate and against nuclear power at the same time my opinion that would be absolutely inconsistent and irrational
