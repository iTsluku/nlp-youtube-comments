i hear a lot of interesting words democracy human rights truth but i see only a bowl with a fodder and millions of pigs who do not see anything outside of this bowl pigs are not interested human rights and truth they are interested fodder and ass warm its funny to see how a young with a brain not yet washed up raises moments that everyone fact knows everyone is worried and do what thats right back to bowl because it is easier and most importantly safer sadly history teaches us nothing sadly the bowl with a fodder outweighs human rights truth and peoples lives on the rights of which the pigs do not care as long as they have a bowl with fodder i hope no one be offended by this small speech because i just opened the nature of life of pigs if people do something similar then i have a bad news for all of us
