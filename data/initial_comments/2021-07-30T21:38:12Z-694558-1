this world wherever there is light there are shadows as long as the concept of winners exists there must be losers the selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars and hatred is born to protect love the face of my enemy scares me only when i realize how much it resembles mine i taught you that order to control people you need to use the darkness their hearts when a learns to love he must bear the risk of hatred people cannot show each other their true feelings fear suspicion and resentment never subside the strong devour the weak that is the law of the world seeks peace yet at the same time yearning for those are the two realms belonging solely to thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do theyre two sides of the same coin to protect something another must be sacrificed the longer you live the more you realize that reality is just made of pain suffering and emptiness wake up to reality nothing ever goes as planned this world the longer you live the more you realize that this reality only pain suffering and futility exist you have the best gift you can have life
