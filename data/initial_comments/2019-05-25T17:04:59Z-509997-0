most of what rezo says about climate science is false climate science has been weaponized and politicized it has taken a small amount of truth and exaggerated it into a huge emergency but there is no climate emergency co2 the atmosphere is increasing and this is causing a small amount of warming but the warming is both small and the temperature response is logarithmic meaning the temperature response to more co2 become smaller as more co2 is added there never be a dangerous level of climate change furthermore we have the models that are produced by the ipcc scientists that he quotes 97 of those models are already proven wrong when compared to actual climate change their predictions have been far far too high sea level emergencies are false over the past 130 years sea levels have risen about 7 centimeters and there is no acceleration since the last ice age sea levels have risen about 110 meters sea level rise is natural and not emergency
