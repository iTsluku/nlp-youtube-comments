yes the cdu seems to have gone the same way as the centerparty sweden which used to be a green party and the spd the same way as the swedish social democratic party which used to be a party for the poor and working classes and your grüne seems to have gone down the same road as our miljöpartiet environmental party that is the absolute best party when it comes to the environmental bit but still entirely impossible to vote for because of its naive stand on immigration and its perverse stand on the lbtqquestions i still stuck with the sweden democrats although they do not prioritize the environmental issues or are coming round very slowly and if i had the right to vote germany i would vote for the afd for the same reasons by the way millions of people from the third world who lack education and therefore do not understand the environmental issues or do not make them their priority and who suddenly out of the blue receive a western standard of life are not good for the environment either fact it is difficult to think of anything harmful for this planet as the migration from poor countries to relatively rich please answer me german if you like
