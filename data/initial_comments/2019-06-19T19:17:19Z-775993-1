jo permafrostboden kanadischen arktis löst schon anstatt angenommen paar jahrzehnten bisschen methan co2 schon genug wäre studie 1062019 httpsagupubsonlinelibrarywileycomdoiabs1010292019gl082187fbclidiwar3trh9cokfdizhloniw9v7urxzuhzmrqy2gmjqixal7jtfmkduxc5axq abstract climate warming regions of ice‐rich permafrost can result widespread thermokarst development which reconfigures the landscape and damages infrastructure we present multi‐site time‐series observations which couple ground temperature measurements with thermokarst development a region of very cold permafrost the canadian high arctic between 2003 and 2016 a series of anomalously warm summers caused mean thawing indices to be 150 – 240 above the 1979‐2000 normal resulting up to 90 cm of subsidence over the 12‐year observation period our data illustrate that despite low mean annual ground temperatures very cold permafrost ‐10°c with massive ground ice close to the surface is highly vulnerable to rapid permafrost degradation and thermokarst development we suggest that this is due to little thermal buffering from soil organic layers and near surface vegetation and the presence of near surface ground ice observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090 under rcp 45
