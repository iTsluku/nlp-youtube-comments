what you tell your children when they ask you what went wrong how can you paint a picture of a paradise lost to eyes that know only a wasteland how you justify watching the world the clock is ticking cant you feel our days are numbered head first into disaster from which there be no return with narrow minds we decimate our one true home cast into oblivion judgment is calling behold the pale horse this is the funeral of the earth behold the pale horse this is the funeral the blind eye can no longer be cast the clock is ticking there is no second chance the blind eye can no longer be cast there be no future if we cant learn from our mistakes the clock is ticking there is no second chance there be no future if we cant learn a forced extinction closes out the age of apathy the final act sacrifice the worlds ecology the death of beauty the death of hope cast before the throne of avarice judgment is calling behold the pale horse this is the funeral of the earth behold the pale horse this is the funeral the blind eye can no longer be cast there be no future if we cant learn from our mistakes the clock is ticking there is no second chance there be no future if we cant learn i cant watch it burn behold the pale horse parkway drive dark days
