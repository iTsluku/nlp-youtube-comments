xxthebl4ckc4txx well first of all thats not true at all there are enough political parties to vote for who would actually change things for the better secondly it ultimately comes down to us citizens it doesnt matter what politicians do if all of us united stop using fossil fuels why don‘t you switch to renewable resources and encourage everyone else to do why don‘t you join initiatives that are constantly looking for new members why don‘t you sign petitions exactly our political and social system provides enough possibilities to take initiative and change the world this isn‘t solely the governments fault its our own
