fire why almost nobody works on it because almost nobody gets the significance of reducing the emissions co2 is a problem saying it isnt problem is a problem too just pretending it is no problem because nobody does something against it is bullshit i could use your logic like this pretend it is 1600 if slavery is a problem why did none of the slave masters or many people do something against it for long if co2 is a problem why dont politicians the ones who mostly create the reasons for emissions and profit from the companies emissioning co2 do something against it hhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
