one critique of the consensus has been published a paper the journal science education the argument made the paper first published by christopher monckton on a climate contrarian blog monckton has suggested the conspiracy theory that the journal environmental research letters created 2006 specifically for the purpose of publishing cook et al 2013 the monckton paper takes the point about quantification above to the extreme it focuses exclusively on the papers that quantified humancaused global warming and takes these as a percentage of all 12000 abstracts captured the literature search thus claiming the consensus is not 97 but rather 03 the logical flaws this argument should be obvious and thus should not have passed through the peerreview process approximately twothirds of abstracts did not take a position on the causes of global warming for various reasons eg the causes were simply not relevant to or a key component of their specific research paper thus order to estimate the consensus on humancaused global warming its necessary to focus on the abstracts that actually stated a position on humancaused global warming when addressing the consensus regarding humans being responsible for the majority of recent global warming the same argument holds true for abstracts that do not quantify the human contribution we simply cant know their position on the issue that doesnt mean they endorse or reject the consensus position they simply dont provide that information and thus must first be removed before estimating the quantified consensus as noted above when we perform this calculation the consensus position that humans are the main cause of global warming is endorsed 87 of abstracts and 96 of full papers moncktons argument is very similar to the myth that co2 cant cause significant global warming because it only comprises 004 of the atmosphere 99 of the atmosphere is comprised of nongreenhouse gases but these other gases are irrelevant to the question of the co2 greenhouse effect the percentage of co2 as a fraction of all gases the atmosphere is irrelevant figure as is the percentage of abstracts quantifying humancaused global warming as a percentage of all abstracts captured our literature search its worth noting that based on moncktons logic only 008 of abstracts reject humancaused global warming
