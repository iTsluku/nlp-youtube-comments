i personally think that leftwing politicians must understand that a welfare state such as germany can never become immigration country as the united states on the other hand rightwing politicians need to understand that hatred and agitation can never bring you further life only iron resolve can do that they have to understand that the aid on the ground developing countries is more effective and cheaper and not wasted as it protects the west from mass immigration from the poorest countries even if some of it is embezzled the splattering of our society is based on the fact that politicians are unable to find solutions longer time ago under the chancery of willy brand it simply acted and the recruitment stop for foreign skilled workers decided instead to debate forever about it and to fuel the debate about the immigration ideologically the past most politicians europe every political heavyweight before mrs merkel were agreement this topic it is about the simple question of whether the right of each individual to choose his country freely stand above the right of a country to defend its socialpolitical achievements and its welfare state httpswwwfaznetanalysedeutschlandein the politicians at that time were not generally against immigration but immigration should not outplay the development aid and there is a difference between immigration from the prosperity countries and the immigration from the poorest third world countries because they need their skilled workers more urgently the good decisions made the third world countries should not be punished they invested a good amount of money educationthese people were usually not trained with our money and it is not particularly fair when the countries of the west lure away million of educated skilled employees the course of a of a race for the smartest heads and the medical staff if only a hand full of skilled employees from the west want to live the poorest third world countries i have not met many doctors and engineers with the wish to live somalia or liberia a fair immigration that does not outplay the development aid can only succeed the form of a fair exchange of skilled workers this means that skilled employee shortages and surpluses should be compared with those of the poorest developing countries and that he skilledemployeedifference is kept to a minimum i think every thesis needs example and germany is one of the best examples of how the immigration policy played out the development aid and i hope that all learn something from it the numbers tell us a different truth as the main stream media want us to believe a welfare state such as germany the arrivel of one million immigrants costs us 55 billion euros a year whereas according to the world bank 3 out of 7 billion people earn less than 2 a day this equates annual income of 730 and with twice the income no child would have to starve over there dividing the annual average costs of 55000 billion euro a welfare state such as germany through the 730 euro annual costs for the local help the developing countries get your the number of people we could have saved arithmetically from starvation if the borders would have been already closed the year 2015 55 billion730 75 million people we could have saved from a cruel starvation death httpswwwfaznetaktuellpolitik78milliardeneurofuerfluechtlingspolitikbis202215598121htmlfbclidiwar0abuihd8iinca0zeo3olmkvxke3u32ikmpdmhvpcjfajzsemyqrcjxg httpswwwfaznetaktuellpolitik78milliardeneurofuerfluechtlingspolitikbis202215598121htmlfbclidiwar0abuihd8iinca0zeo3olmkvxke3u32ikmpdmhvpcjfajzsemyqrcjxg httpswwwweltdepolitikdeutschlandarticle168045986migrantenueberweisen42millhttpswwwfaznetaktuellpolitik78milliardeneurofuerfluechtlingspolitikbis202215598121htmlfbclidiwar0abuihd8iinca0zeo3olmkvxke3u32ikmpdmhvpcjfajzsemyqrcjxgiardeneuroinheimatlaenderhtmlfbclidiwar0pciojeyl093xn6olop7dyke2bijlwzpcbzddgzaihnzkivhghwhdnwa the immigrants only transferred â‚¬ 42 billion back to their home countries the federal budget is not unlimited and as a result of the too liberal immigration policy the federal budget significantly reduced which had a significant impact on the budget of the ministry of development now even less money is transfered back the poorest developing countries and the savings the budget of the ministry of development far exceed the amount money which is being transfered back from the migrants there countries of origin science has to address this issue and the former president of the most prestigious economic institute institute said the following httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdapaxch3eo8t488s our developing minister demanded the change the immigration policy to finance a turnaround the development policy it is a sad truth that many of the past successful syrian refugees and there children as steve jobs not invested afterwards enough money there country of origin syria
