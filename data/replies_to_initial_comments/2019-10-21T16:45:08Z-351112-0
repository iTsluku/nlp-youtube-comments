tragic i work with windpower and i see how the manufacturers close or severely cut back production germany only to move it to china turkey mexico india etc anywhere where they can dump wages its still cheaper to transport them back to europe half across the world germany is loosing their windpower manufacturers and at the same time they should be installing 7gw per year to reach the climate goals those must be powerful lobbyists with big pockets to pay off the german government
