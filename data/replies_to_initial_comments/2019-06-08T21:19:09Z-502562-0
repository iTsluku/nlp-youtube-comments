this misinterpretation of the neoliberal wisdoms of the recent years does not stay unnoticed europe we suffered from massive immigration and for decades the political union germany operated with the campaign slogan that a social state as germany can never be immigration country which explicitly seeks for immigration from the poorest countries it is true that all people benefit it if the interests of the corporations are not ignored but exceptions confirm the rule the people here do not profit from the fact that some corporations want bring millions of skilled employees into the country and if housing get subsidized if the coroperations should rather educate their own population well already the training of a simple employee as a cta mta bta costs a company arround 200000 euro and some would rather import those skilled epmloyees from the poorest countries of the world which we should rather help immediatly because 80 million refugees are sitting on packed suitcases this a red line that helmut kohl willy brand or helmut schmidt would have never crossed which cause imbalance between the interests of the the population and the industry which noticed the shift of the political equilibrium europe and many countries after 6 years every immigrant have the right to get his flat payed from the tax payer and is fully entitled to get payed out a basic pension which is only marginally below the pension of those who have pursued a simple manual job their lives and worked for 40 years to get paid there pension these subsidized housing and other promises have been endorsed by the industry and likely be broken the future it is true that we benefit from free trade with countries where similar conditions prevail and comparable wages are paid out it is true that we benefit from immigration as it is true that we do not profit from the immigration from every country open borders for all and the free shift of human capital from the poorest countries is neoliberalnonsense which neither advances the west nor the poorest developing countries and immigration law which is being extended to the middle east the balkans and the poorest developing countries is a step this direction it is true that our too liberal immigration policy is harming the countries most effected from emigration as it is true that some people might think that closing the borders would give some people the feeling that the west want to exclude these people from our western prosperity even if the opposite is the case for that reason this topic should not be endlessly discussed and it should rather be acted years ago small well integrable groups of refugees stood front of our doorsteps but the future our borders become increasingly ineffective because hordes of refugees are now standing infront of our borders or are sitting on packed suitcasesthe too liberal immigration lead to a point where borders won´t be working anymore and masses of immigrants endanger our welfare state because the skilled labor supply is not infinite and the more skilled workers as engineers and doctors leave the poorest countries the more poverty migrants start there journey for this reason newly created ways for legal immigration not reduce illegal immigration or the evil of human trafficking the people want a more responsible foreign policy fewer wars and fairer trade agreements because it is not thought sustainable t if politics had not exaggerated it with the immigration the who would not have criticized that decission t the policy does not seem capable to distinguish between the required immigration of the few scientists which would able to build a fusion power plant or a quantum computer and don´t find work there country and between the immigration of less educated professionals such as doctors which are urgently needed their countries its not about not helping people who are looking for help but some thinktanks actually think that germany would need 300000 immigrants every year the first promise of prosperity which would be left behind is the right to live your own apartment germany can not stomp a city out of the ground every year the majority of people germany demand a greener environmental policy but think that a basic income might become necessary the future and therefore wish for a more restrictive immigration policy people know that a basic income would require a more restrictive immigration policy and a financial transaction tax and if it should be high enough it would replace our current pension system
